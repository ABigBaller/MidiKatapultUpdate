Version 1.2

Thank you for downloading Katapult!

To get started, read the "Katapult Documentation" PDF.

Important!
You need Java installed to run Katapult. You need at least version 1.6.

Very important!!
If you are using Mac, DO NOT run Katapult in 64-bit mode. Katapult is NOT STABLE in 64-bit mode! There is an issue with java when running in 64-bit mode that messes up Katapults thread syncronization. This will most probably make Katapult crash at some point, or make it eat a lot of CPU power. If you are experiencing problems, please check whether Katapult runs in 64-bit mode. You can do this by opening up "Activity Monitor". If "Intel (64-bit)" is listed in the "Kind" column for Katapult, please change you Java settings to use the 32-bit VM instead. Open up "Java Preferences" and drag the 32-bit option to the top of the list. Also, try showing info (cmd-i) on the Katapult application, and check the "Run in 32-bit mode" checkbox.

If you are using Snow Leopard, make sure you have updated to at least 10.6.2, since there was a Java bug in prior versions, that will make Katapult cry. Also, make sure you have the latest Java updates from
Apple.

If you are having trouble starting Katapult, please update your Java version. Also, if Katapult cannot detect your Launchpad, please make sure that you have the latest Launchpad USB drivers installed. These can be dawnloaded from Novations website at http://www.novationmusic.com/support/launchpad/.

Important! Please see the "Known Issues" section, for notes on a bug related to Carbon based virtual MIDI drivers (seems to have been fixed
in Apples latest Java updated as of 25th of May 2010).

-----------
Known issues:

- [This issue has been resolved as of Apple's May 2010 Java update]
Sometimes, Katapult won't start due to a memory access error, if other MIDI applications are already running. If this happens, try closing the other applications, start Katapult, and then start up the other applications again. Please see the documentation pdf for more info on this issue. Unfortunately, I am unable to provide a fix at this time, since the bug resides in Apples Java implementation. You can get around this issue by using IAC drivers.

Happy Katapulting!
